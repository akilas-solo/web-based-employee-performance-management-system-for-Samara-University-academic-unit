## Overview

The Samara University Academic Performance Evaluation System is a web-based application designed to facilitate the evaluation of academic staff performance. The system supports multiple user roles with different permissions and provides features for managing evaluations, generating reports, and analyzing performance data.

## System Architecture

The system follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns. It is built using a custom PHP framework that incorporates elements of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern while maintaining simplicity and ease of maintenance.

### Architectural Components

1. **Presentation Layer**
   - User interface components (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
   - Bootstrap framework for responsive design
   - jQuery for DOM manipulation
   - Chart.js for data visualization

2. **Application Layer**
   - PHP controllers for handling requests
   - Business logic for evaluation processes
   - Authentication and authorization
   - Data validation and processing

3. **Data Access Layer**
   - Database abstraction
   - Data models
   - Query builders
   - Data validation

4. **Infrastructure Layer**
   - Configuration management
   - Logging
   - Error handling
   - Security mechanisms

### Request Flow

1. User sends a request to the server
2. The request is routed to the appropriate controller
3. The controller processes the request and interacts with the data models
4. Data models interact with the database
5. The controller prepares the data for presentation
6. The view renders the HTML response
7. The response is sent back to the user

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Bootstrap 4.6
- jQuery 3.6
- Chart.js 2.9
- DataTables 1.10
- Font Awesome 5.15

### Backend
- PHP 7.4+
- MySQL 5.7+ / MariaDB 10.3+
- Apache 2.4+ / Nginx 1.18+

### Development Tools
- Git for version control
- Composer for dependency management
- npm for frontend package management
- PHPUnit for testing

## Database Design

The database follows a relational model with normalized tables to minimize redundancy and maintain data integrity. The schema includes tables for users, colleges, departments, evaluation periods, evaluation criteria, evaluations, and evaluation responses.

### Key Tables

#### Users
Stores user information including authentication details and role assignments.

#### Colleges
Stores information about academic colleges within the university.

#### Departments
Stores information about academic departments within colleges.

#### Evaluation Periods
Defines evaluation periods with start and end dates.

#### Evaluation Categories
Defines categories for evaluation criteria.

#### Evaluation Criteria
Defines specific criteria used for evaluations, organized by category.

#### Evaluations
Stores evaluation instances, linking evaluators, evaluatees, and evaluation periods.

#### Evaluation Responses
Stores individual responses to evaluation criteria within an evaluation.

### Relationships

- A College has many Departments (one-to-many)
- A Department belongs to one College (many-to-one)
- A User may belong to one Department (many-to-one)
- A User may belong to one College (many-to-one)
- An Evaluation has one Evaluator (many-to-one)
- An Evaluation has one Evaluatee (many-to-one)
- An Evaluation belongs to one Evaluation Period (many-to-one)
- An Evaluation has many Evaluation Responses (one-to-many)
- An Evaluation Response belongs to one Evaluation (many-to-one)
- An Evaluation Response is for one Evaluation Criteria (many-to-one)
